The 'randomly_generated_instances_detailed_information' provides the detailed information related to the size, degree of the instances, problem density and nonlinearity.
The column headers are described in further detail below:
1. Instance - Name of the instance
2. Degree - Degree of the instance
3. NV - Number of variables in the instance
4. NIC - Number of inequality constraints in the instance
5. NEC - Number of equality constraints in the instance
6. d - Problem density defined as the ratio between the existing nonlinear monomials in the problem formulation and all possible nonlinear monomials for the given number of variables
7. d1 - Problem density relating to the linear equality constraints
8. NZ - Number of non-zeroes in the instance
9. NLC - CODE LENGTH of the instance
10. NLNZ - Number of nonliner non-zeroes in the instance
