# Supplementary information
Supplementary data for the manuscript _Assessment of a Two-Step Approach for Global Optimization of Mixed-Integer Polynomial Programs using Quadratic Reformulation_.
It consists of four directories:
1. instances - provides the list of all instances considered in this study alongwith their source and details of the test instances
2. Pre_processor_times - provides the csv file with the time taken for pre-processing and reformulation in CANON for each instance
3. GAMS_files - provides the instances in .gms format for the instances not available in MINLPLib and also provides the reformulated MIQCP instances
4. Log_files - provides the log files in zip archives for all the instances considered for all the solvers and solver configurations
