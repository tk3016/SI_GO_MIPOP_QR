The log files for all instances considered for all solvers and solver configuration can be found in this folder.
The log files are classified by randomly generated polynomial instances (74) and application based instances (67).
GUROBI, SCIP and BARON log files are provided in sub-directories for each in the parent directory which is based on type of instance. Furthermore, in the sub-directory named by the corresponding solver, sub-directories either named by the reformulation setting in CANON for MIQCP models or named as 'Original' for MIPOP models can be found. These sub-directories contain the individual log files for each model.
